<h3>How supportive and efficient was Blue Zinc IT during the initial installation process?</h3>

<p>“From our initial contacts with Blue Zinc we have built up a personal relationship with them with only occasional difficulties with the Belfast accent!”“They have been superb both before and after upgrading from old Time Machine to TM2. They efficiently, clearly and simply answer 99% of our queries and can accurately give a time scale of when any problems will be sorted.”</p>

<h3>How has TM2 worked for you?</h3>

<p>“We book all our appointments in TM2 and invoices and receipts are issued from the system. We also control our aged debtors and find it easy to access information, e.g. patient details.”</p>

<h3>The benefits of TM2</h3>

<p>“I was dragged reluctantly into computerising my Practice, but it immediately brought in money owing, provided much more accountability of stock, expenditure, income, patient numbers and helped me as a Clinician to run a business. TM2 is purpose built and designed for Health Service and Clinics such as Physiotherapy, Osteopathy etc.”</p>

<h3>How would you rate TM2 support?</h3>

<p>“The support at the end of the phone is quick and TM2 is very user friendly. We can easily email problems directly from TM2 and Blue Zinc usually sort out any problems that day. It seems that most things that we have asked for have been customised to suit our practice needs. The system is definitely user driven.”</p>
