<h3>How Has TM2 Worked For You?</h3>

TM2 is a great way for me to pull together all the aspects of my business. It allows me to keep track of patient notes, write referral letters from template, and keeps control and track of the financial transactions taking place through the week.

<h3>Benefits of TM2</h3>

I am able to get access to my patient notes from different clinics, and because the other practitioners working for me use the same system – we are able to see immediately what treatment the patient is receiving therefore helping to provide direction when planning treatment. I am able to keep a close eye on my finances so that I always know how much is coming in and what stock needs to be ordered. The reminder features are great at helping me keep track of phones calls and tasks during a busy day, and the level of support is great as it means that any problems are dealt with quickly and with minimal disruption.

<h3>How Would You Rate Blue Zinc Support?</h3>

I think TM2 is by far the best overall management system on the market because of the attention to detail and functionality built into it. Great system with great support makes for a happy practice.

<h3>Do You Believe TM2 Will Help You In The Future?</h3>

TM2 is a very progressive system and as Blue Zinc continues to grow and expand I am sure that TM2 will provide me with even more valuable tools to help develop and run my business efficiently
