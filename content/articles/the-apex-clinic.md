<h2>Established in 1998, Apex Clinic is now one of the leading providers of specialist care in Northern Ireland. With further expansion in 2001, Apex Clinic now offers a purpose built clinic providing the highest standards of patient care and service.</h2>

<p>The team comprises seven full time physiotherapists headed by Rebecca Nelson, three podiatrists headed by Martin McGeough, a chiropodist, massage therapist and consultant in Pain Management. Their practice manager is Tim Moore.</p>


<h3>How supportive and efficient was Blue Zinc IT during the initial installation process?</h3>

<p>The initial installation process was dealt with very effectively and any problems were dealt with quickly.</p>

<h3>How has TM2 worked for you?</h3>

<p>Having migrated from an alternative private practice software system TM2 has worked extremely well and all our practitioners have commented on its ease of use.</p>

<h3>The benefits of TM2</h3>

<p>The TM2 software is straight forward to use, particularly for our practitioners who require fast and easy access to patient details, diary etc. It also offers various levels of access making it much easier to monitor the administration side of our business, which is very useful in a large clinic.</p>

<h3>How would you rate TM2 support?</h3>

<p>Fortunately once the software was installed and any minor glitches were sorted out we have had very little contact with the support staff which is a great reflection on the TM2 package. Any contact with the Blue Zinc staff has always been a very positive experience. Blue Zinc are always looking to improve TM2 by listening to the requirements of customers and any improvements to the software are updated.</p>

<h3>How will TM2 help you in the future?</h3>

<p>TM2 is an integral part of our business, as our networked system expands it is reassuring to know that TM2 can easily expand with us.</p>
