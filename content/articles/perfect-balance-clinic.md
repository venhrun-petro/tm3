<h2>Perfect Balance Clinic is a specialist clinic for Physiotherapy, Osteopathy, Sports Injuries and Mother and Baby Services and operates six busy clinics within London and Hertfordshire.</h2>

<p>Stephen Makinde is one of the lead practitioners at the clinic and as you can imagine working with international royal family, premiership footballers (Arsenal, Chelsea and QPR) and TV celebrities he is very much in demand as a top specialist in his field.</p>

<h3>How Supportive And Efficient Was Blue Zinc IT During The Initial Installation Process?</h3>

<p>Since our first contact with Blue Zinc IT we have been very impressed with their level of customer service and attention to detail, something that we take pride in ourselves as a company, its rare to meet other businesses that are so focused on retention (via good practices) and not so sales driven.  The installation process went smoothly and there have been very few problems if any that haven’t been sorted out quickly and without complication or delay in our service delivery.</p>

<h3>How Has TM2 Worked For You?</h3>

<p>TM2 has been instrumental to our development as a practice on many levels.  We use it on a daily basis for note taking, accounting processes and general administration that run hand in hand with being in a busy clinic.</p>

<h3>Benefits of TM2</h3>

<p>The main benefits of TM2 thus far have been the ease of use which we have found to be important in developing the current clinics we have.  The multi–site capability has resolved issues related to clients moving between sites and is an integral part to the service we provide as a clinic.  The friendly support staff who can never do enough to help us mean that even when there is a problem (usually through our own error) it is dealt with quickly and efficiently. The pace at which their company is moving means that Blue Zinc are always ahead of us in their development. They are very responsive to suggestions we make to improve the software if it doesn’t quite suit what we do.</p>

<h3>How Would You Rate Blue Zinc Support?</h3>

<p>I think words and numbers cannot describe how grateful we are as a team to the team behind Blue Zinc IT.  If I had to rate them it would surely be 10/10.</p>

<h3>Do You Believe TM2 Will Help You In The Future?</h3>

<p>I have no doubt that as our business continues to grow TM2 will continue to deliver services which surpass our needs to allow us to develop. I only wish we had used them from the start rather than wasting time with other software, I am sure knowing now what I know about the healthcare industry, my business and private practice software we would not hesitate in recommending Blue Zinc IT and TM2 to anyone looking for private practice software which is good value for money and comprehensive.</p>
