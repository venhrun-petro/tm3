<h2>Sheffield Chiropractic Clinic has been established since 1980 and has 3 clinics in central England.</h2>

 They have been using TM2 since early 2007. At present they are using it in their very busy reception, but they hope to expand.

<h3>How supportive and efficient was Blue Zinc IT during the initial installation process?</h3>

“The migration was seamless and the installation easy.”

<h3>How has TM2 worked for you?</h3>

“TM2 eased booking in of patients simultaneously on phone and clinic having 2 terminals rather than two receptionists sharing 1 diary. It is also easier tracking debtors and we are constantly able to reconcile takings with the cash tin.”

<h3>Benefits of TM2</h3>

“It is a far easier transition from a paper based system than any of my receptionists had imagined. No major nightmares at all– even in the first few weeks.”

“Another benefit is the option of custom made reports, which I’m hoping to take advantage of shortly.”

<h3>How would you rate TM2 support?</h3>

“The Support team are always helpful and friendly and my receptionists love the accent!”

<h3>Do You Believe That TM2 Will Help You In The Future?</h3>
