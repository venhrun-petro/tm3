<h3>How supportive and efficient was Blue Zinc IT during the initial installation process?</h3>

I had the reception computer stolen last year on a Friday night. On Monday I phoned TM2 with a new computer wired in and they spent the next few hours controlling the computer and setting up TM2 again: saved my bacon. They were unfussed, cool in the crisis and efficient and I was up and running again in no time at all.

<h3>How Has TM2 Worked For You?</h3>

TM2 itself has been great, especially with the recent upgrades

<h3>Benefits of TM2</h3>

I have felt confident that all of our diaries work, and therefore all our billing, has been accurate.

<h3>How Would You Rate Blue Zinc Support?</h3>

Blue Zinc support has been great – it’s been available when I’ve needed it and quiet when I’ve not. It’s even had time to discuss the weather in Belfast when I’ve phoned.

<h3>Do You Believe That TM2 Will Help You In The Future?</h3>

In the near future I want TM2 to adapt to the small changes I, and I suspect others, are suggesting just to make it a legendary system and I want it to be cheaper (of course). In the long term I will look at moving onto the touch screen version to make the whole system faster, more accurate and less hassle with paper at the front desk.
