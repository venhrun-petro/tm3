<h3>How supportive and efficient was Blue Zinc IT during the initial installation process?</h3>

“Blue Zinc I.T have been very supportive and efficient.”

<h3>How has TM2 worked for you?</h3>

“I have enjoyed using TM2 as it is easy to use and navigate. It has been competitively priced making it an attractive option. I have been able to incorporate I.T. into my practice fairly painlessly. It has been enabled me to have an off–site telephone receptionist to make bookings even when I’m away!”

<h3>The benefits of TM2</h3>

“It is relatively easy to use and very adaptable. It is easy to customise. The case record section is very comprehensive and adaptable. The diary is clear at a glance.”

<h3>How would you rate TM2 support?</h3>

 “The Support team has been exceptional. They have been unceasingly helpful, cheerful, friendly and above all very very very patient. They have always answered the phone and never seem to put clients through the inconvenience of being on hold or having to chose endless options.”

<h3>How will TM2 help you in the future?</h3>

“Once I get round to sorting myself out with the TM2 Touch it will become much easier to keep case records especially for easy clinical audit.”
