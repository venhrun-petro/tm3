<h2>Hantscare is a single handed Practice with a small administration support staff specialising in Musculo–skeletal medicine, in particular Sports Injuries, Personal Injury claims and Occupational Health. </h2>

They operate a number of satellite clinics in the workplace.

<h3>How supportive and efficient was Blue Zinc IT during the initial installation process?</h3>

“Blue Zinc have been very easy to work with at all stages of the process of moving to TM2. Their support has been invaluable in the relatively pain free process.”

“Their after sales support has been extremely useful and helpful – always on the end of the phone or email. They have responded quickly to any problems we have encountered, often emailing us updates to the programme within hours.”

<h3>How has TM2 worked for you?</h3>

“The user interface is easy and up–to–date. Invoicing, appointment making and tracking of the clinics functions within TM2 is very easy and straightforward.”

“In particular I have liked the emphasis on the patient account making the whole accounting process (e.g. receiving payments in parts and dealing with excesses to pay) much easier.”

<h3>The benefits of TM2</h3>

“When I look back on how much time we spent on keeping track of appointments, invoicing and all the other mundane administration you have to do in running a practice and compare it with using a computer based system there is no comparison.”

“TM2 allows us to keep track of most aspects of running the business side of the practice from one programme with only a few mouse clicks. I could not consider returning to a non–computerised system.”

<h3>How would you rate TM2 support?</h3>

“The support we have had is second to none. All our problems have been solved quickly or a very honest explanation has been given as to the reason it could not be fixed immediately. The support team listen to suggestions for improvements and act on them – we are very satisfied.”

<h3>How will TM2 help you in the future?</h3>

“I am certainly looking forward to using the new developments of being able to offer online appointment booking and access to the system from satellite clinics. We hope to move to a paperless office, keeping all our records electronically in the near future.”
