<h3>How Supportive And Efficient Was Blue Zinc IT During The Initial Installation Process?</h3>

Blue Zinc IT couldn’t have been more helpful or patient during the set up process. They were always there to answer queries and their support materials and testing were easy to follow. Their sales approach is not pushy in any way, but very helpful and patient.

<h3>How Has TM2 Worked For You?</h3>

I wished I had started using the system earlier. I had investigated many systems over the last few years doing many trials and demos, but this was the most user friendly. I love the screens and use of colour, rather than just a black and white screen of many of the systems I had tried. I just made a quick decision to go with it and the transition was made very easy by the support and sales team.

<h3>Benefits of TM2</h3>

There is an excellent training section using identical screens to the live system, which you can dip into prior to going live, working through setting up the system exactly as you would like with practitioners, patients, etc. before using it for real. The manuals and user guides are very easy to follow. Support staff were always available to answer any queries I may have had. I know training courses are available, but I managed to do everything without this as the user guides were very clear and help was on hand from the support team.

For the first time ever, I have been able to print invoices or receipts straight after a treatment to insurance companies at the touch of a button, rather than take them home to do at the weekend or evening. This gives me extra freedom to enjoy my leisure time as a one man band.

GP letters are easy to write as everything is linked up with templates, etc. so I am able to make more contact with them as well as doing mailshots, reminders, etc. for patients at a touch of a button.When you think of the time, therefore money saved when the system is up and running, the small cost of moving with the times is worth every penny. Only wished I had done this years ago.

The system is easy to use for a small practice or a larger one and is easily changeable to either.

<h3>How Would You Rate Blue Zinc Support?</h3>

All members of the team are very friendly, helpful, efficient, knowledgeable and supportive far exceeding expectations.

<h3>Do You Believe TM2 Will Help You In The Future?</h3>

My next plan is to use the Touch patient notes, but I thought I would take one step at a time. Again looking at other systems this was the most superior and visually pleasing one for me. I have no regrets whatsoever. I did try another system which gave a free 30 day trial, but found it was not so easy for me to set up and I lost interest.
