<h2>Eskbank Chiropractic Clinic was established in May 2000 and consists of two chiropractors and two chiropractic assistants.</h2>

Dr Thomson is the team Chiropractor for Melrose Rugby Club and former Chiropractor for Celtic and Motherwell Football Clubs.

The clinic decided in May 2008 to move from paper to TM2 Practice Management system.

<h3>How supportive and efficient was Blue Zinc IT during the initial installation process?</h3>

The Installation phase and training couldn’t have gone easier. The training was done in my clinic, which was especially helpful and cost effective for my staff. The TM2 support team were also very helpful and efficient in dealing with all my queries, along with those of my receptionists and IT personnel.

<h3>How has TM2 worked for you?</h3>

TM2 has allowed me to streamline my front desk and practice management procedures. At a glance, I am able to keep up to date on how my practice is performing, with more detailed analysis being available via the specific reports built into the system.

<h3>Benefits of TM2</h3>

TM2 software has enabled me to take better clinical notes more efficiently. TM2 has templates already created to suit general practice and the system can be easily customized. I have been able to access TM2 not only from my clinic but also the other locations I work “Live” via a high security internet connection.

<h3>How would you rate TM2 support?</h3>

The support team are very helpful, efficient and supportive; I would grade them as A+. Their knowledge is endless and they always seem to have the right solution.

<h3>Would you recommend TM2 to another clinic?</h3>

Definitely! I am very happy with the company and the product.
