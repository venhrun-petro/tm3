<h2>The Physio Company provides a range of services including physiotherapy, acupuncture, massage, ergonomic assessments and Corporate Health services from a chain of clinics across Dublin. </h2>

The business focuses strongly on continual evidence based education and training to ensure the highest standards of patient care.

TM2 manages the administrative, clinical and managerial parts of the business across all sites. Using TM2′s multi location functionality, reception staff can book appointments live into each location from one central location. With the TM2 Hosted service, the Physio Company now have the peace of mind that all business critical information is securely stored off site, with back ups now a thing of the past.


<h3>How supportive and efficient was Blue Zinc IT during the initial installation process?</h3>

Once the deal was agreed between management, very quickly thereafter we were appointed a dedicated TM2 technical consultant who handled the whole installation and set up process.

We were able to convey what we needed to achieve in terms of our business, migration of our existing data from our old system and clinic structure going forward. The installation and training all occurred efficiently and with due regard to timing that was convenient to our business.

<h3>How has TM2 worked for you?</h3>

Very well. It is an easy to use logical system and allows us to manage our business easily and efficiently.

Put it this way, I have no complaints and there are very few of our supplier partners that I would put into that category.

<h3>The benefits of TM2</h3>

The benefits of TM2 have been considerable for our Company. The 3 different facets of TM2 work perfectly.

In pure clinical terms, recording patient notes is extremely easy, efficient and effective. In terms of reception staff, the diary and daily accounts are easy to use and logical.

From management’s perspective, for a multi–location operation like us the benefits of TM2 are considerable, from our central location we can get accurate and live data across the whole network and the reporting is excellent.

<h3>How would you rate TM2 support?</h3>

In my opinion BZ’s main strength is in its support team. From installation to today, we have dealt with support staff that are accessible, knowledgeable and efficient.

Downtime is virtually non–existent and should there be any small problems, these are rectified within minutes, not hours or even days like our previous supplier.

<h3>Would you recommend TM2?</h3>

TM2 “does what it says on the tin” and so allows us to focus our attention on what is really important. That is treating patients and from my own perspective managing and improving the business.

I would have no hesitation in recommending TM2, however I would much rather that our competitors do not know about it!
