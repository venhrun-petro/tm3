The clinic specialises in many areas including sports massage and includes an exercise specialist as part of their team. They began using TM2 in 2005.

<h3>How supportive and efficient was Blue Zinc IT during the initial installation process?</h3>

“Thanks to all at Blue Zinc for helping to take our business onto a different level in terms of professionalism and customer care.”

<h3>How has TM2 worked for you?</h3>

“TM2 has proved an absolute revolution for us. No more paper diaries, rubbing out appointments, errors and wasted time. The product is fantastic and support cannot be faulted. I think you would have to go a very long way to find anything to match the software or the dedication of the support team.”

<h3>The benefits of TM2</h3>

“TM2 can be learned quickly but is also immensely powerful. It frees up time for everyone to do what they are best at doing and that benefits those who work in the business and those who visit as clients. The management information it provides enables us to keep on top of our business and maintain a level of control and adaptability that would otherwise be impossible.”
