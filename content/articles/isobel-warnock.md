<h3>How long have you been using TM2?</h3>

<p>I have been using TM2 for over 7 years. It provides a complete package for all administration and a comprehensive patient record system.</p>

<h3>How supportive have the Blue Zinc team been?</h3>

<p>Blue Zinc was extremely supportive and guided me through the set up process with ease. Down the  years since installation whenever I have had a small problem the support team have always been responsive and able to fix the problem either remotely or by dialling into my system. They have responded to market pressures by enabling us to create reports as required by some private health insurance companies. This of course does necessitate inputting of the required data as I go along! In addition TM2 constantly respond to ideas and requests from users, upgrading the system regularly to stay abreast of current trends and continue to maximise ‘user friendliness’!</p>

<h3>How has TM2 worked for you?</h3>

<p>TM2 is an invaluable package, enabling me to move towards being paper free. It enables me to keep all records, letters, reports and copies of ‘X’ rays and scans within the individual patient record. I have been able to create assessment formats that were not already on the system. This was an easy process allowing me to incorporate course material quickly into my assessment and treatment plans. TM2 also helps me keep abreast of payments and money owing with reports that can be accessed instantly and easily. I use ‘Healthcode’ through TM2 to send invoices to most major health insurance companies. This again is a simple and quick process allowing me to send all invoices in one file and keeping all financial records in one place!</p>

<h3>Would you recommend TM2?</h3>

<p>I cannot recommend TM2 highly enough and would not want to be without it! Their response to current trends makes it an invaluable tool for me looking toward the future and being able to react to the ever changing market.</p>

<p>It is always a pleasure to listen to the gentle northern Irish accents especially as they can almost always answer my question, however daft I may have been!</p>
