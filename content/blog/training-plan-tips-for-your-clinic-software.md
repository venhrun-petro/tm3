The clinic software you use is only as good as the person who is using it. 
For example, at TM3 we understand that we have the best clinic software in the world (OK, maybe a little biassed), with lots of [features](www.tm3practicemanagement.com/tour) which can help a clinic improve efficiency and revenue. This is fantastic, but unless our clients know how to use TM3’s features, there’s no benefit to anyone.

To fully benefit from your clinic software, you must first gain a high-level understanding of it. To create a successful training plan for your practice, there are a few things, clinic side, you can do to help ensure the best possible outcome. Today, we want to share with you 5 training elements your practice needs to consider in order to make an effective training plan, making training your staff as simple as possible. 

<h2>1. Your staff know best!</h2>

When it comes to any type of change in your practice, communication is key! Staff involvement creates motivation, which is exactly what you need when training. Your staff should have a good understanding of what they need, which will help when planning the different types and levels of training.

<h2>2. Practitioners differ</h2>

Training needs vary depending on if you are making the switch from old clinic software to a new one, or converting from paper notes to electronic clinical notes. Training needs also vary across each member of staff in your practice. Some of your staff might be more familiar with technology than others, so it is important that you assess each individual.

<h2>3. The more options the better</h2>

Take a look at the different training options your clinic software offers, and decide which of them will help your practice succeed. Depending on your practice, practitioners may not have time to attend a training day in the city, so webinars might provide a more convenient style of learning. Some members of staff may prefer a one-on-one approach, which would indicate phone training as the best training option. It’s very important your clinic software provider offers you a range of different training types.

<h2>4. Rome wasn’t built in a day</h2>

Your training will not be completed overnight, it will take time. You should set a realistic timeline for when you expect your practice to tackle training .When setting your timeline, keep your individual practice needs and schedule in mind so you don't end up feeling like you are lagging, or rushing through your training.

<h2>5. Your journey begins now!</h2>

Once you have your plan set, it is time to start training! While the basic goals and objectives of your training plan should remain consistent throughout, some details might need to change along the way. Constant communication is required to ensure the timeline is being met, and your staff are receiving the appropriate training. It’s also important that your training is continuous, and does not stop with learning the basics. Does your clinical software provider organise webinars/ training for professional users? 

Training does not need to be stressful. If you take this plan and apply it, your staff will be fully prepared to deal with your clinic software. 
With TM3, we offer clients free e-training including webinars, how-to-guides, an extensive knowledge base etc. There is also the option to take advantage of an implementation buddy, phone training, on-site training and group training.
