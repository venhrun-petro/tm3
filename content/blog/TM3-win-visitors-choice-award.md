<h2>TM3 is delighted to announce we won the Visitors Choice Award at the 2016 Physical Rehab World Awards</h2>

A huge thank-you to everyone who voted for TM3 at the recent Physical Rehab World Awards. We are extremely overwhelmed by all your support and praise! On another note, due to an administration error on COPA’s part, TM3 was sadly not judged for the Business Of The Year Award. 

<h2>What is the Visitors Choice Award?</h2>

This award was voted by the delegates at the recent COPA exhibition. After viewing each product at the show, delegates used the power of Twitter to cast their vote for who they believed was the inspiration of the show. 

<h2>Why did we win the award?</h2>

This award is due to our dedication to innovation, continual software development and our strong focus on providing the best customer experience to all our clients. 
Along with the huge demand for TM3, we have managed to continue to develop innovative solutions for the {{ i18n "msk" }} sector, whilst continuing to serve our clients with the attention and training they need to help improve their clinics. With TM3 only arriving in April 2016, the future looks bright for the industry’s new practice management system and we are happy to see the visitors to COPA think so too.

<h2>What do we put our success down to? </h2>
Hard work and a commitment to our clients' success. TM3 is based on shared success, which means we are fully invested in helping our clients reduce administration and streamline their clinics. Everything we do as an organisation, from development to support, is designed to help practitioners manage their practice better and grow clinic revenue. The demand and praise TM3 is receiving speaks for itself. At Blue Zinc Headquarters we are very, very proud of this award, and hope it’s the first of many!

We would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our clients - we wouldn't be here without you! Let's see what the next year brings!
