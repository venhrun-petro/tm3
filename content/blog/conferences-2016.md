TM3 will be travelling far and wide this November, attending a total of 4 conferences. After the recent success at the COPA Show, winning the [Business Service Of The Year Award](https://www.tm3practicemanagement.com/learning/inside-tm3-blog/business-service-of-the-year/) (voted by the audience at the event), we are pretty excited to show delegates what TM3 has to offer. This is a great opportunity to catch a glimpse of TM3 in all its glory, or grab a coffee and chat to our client relationship managers.

<h3>Physio First Scotland</h3>

The first stop on the TM3 conference tour is the lovely town of Grangemouth. Physio First Scotland will take place in the Grangemouth hotel on the 11th-12th November. Attending will be Client Relationship Manager Peter Garrett.


<h3>College Of Podiatry</h3>

Staying in Scotland, TM3's next stop is the College of Podiatry Conference in Glasgow. The conference will take place at the SECC on the 17th-19th November. Attending will be Peter Garrett and Steafan Brown.

<h4>About the conference</h4>

<h3>Therapy Expo</h3>

Last stop on the TM3 conference tour is Birmingham. Therapy Expo will take place from 23rd-24th November at the NEC. Be prepared to be amazed as there might be a little (huge) surprise. Attending will be Peter McMorrow, Peter Garrett and Joseph Johnston.

<h4>About the conference</h4>
Therapy Expo claims to have the nation's favourite conference, and also the best value for money therapy event. That's a bold claim, but they back up this claim with industry research.  Guests can obtain up to 40 hours of self-accredited CPD.
