It may be a novel approach but bear with me on this ... Setting up a grocery stall in a market is similar to your clinic. Just like a market stall you need to display your wears in the most appealing way possible to attract customers. When you go to a market there are usually lots of stalls and if you don’t like what you see you keep on walking until you find something that appeals. Perhaps a friend recommended a particular market trader to go to for the best fruit and veg or a great butcher. Alternatively if you shop at supermarkets I’m sure you will have discussed where to find the best deals or tasty offers with friends and colleagues. Of course healthcare is very different to fruit and veg but the decisions that patients make are grounded in these daily patterns so you need to set up your stall as well and as visible as possible! It also illustrates the importance of patient to patient referral and is the foundation of many clinics.

So how can you make your clinic more attractive in a modern world?

<h2>Website:</h2>

A clear, concise and updated website with easy access to appointments is a great start but many clinics are slow on the uptake with this. There’s nothing worse than an out of date or unloved website, remember it’s setting your stall in the market place! Why not check out TM3’s deal with Physio123 who can design a perfect webpage to get you going and take the stress out of it? For more information on how to get a free website for your clinic, send us a message on sales chat.

<h2>Modern information leaflets / materials:</h2>

Simple but effective leaflets are great to highlight the various services you offer and the benefits of treatment, check with your professional body as they often have approved up to date material which is great to pass on to patients.

<h2>Patient experience:</h2>

People’s expectations are certainly on the rise especially in healthcare. Easy access to services are expected, as more people turn to the internet to have shopping ordered and delivered it makes sense that you should offer the same convenience.

These days you can’t afford to have your doors closed when a patient needs help but at the same time you can’t work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, so what do you do without crippling your clinic with costs? Well of course TM3 is the answer .... I would say that wouldn’t I? Yes, your right I am biased but for theright reasons.
