World Physical Therapy Day was started by [WCPT](http://www.wcpt.org/) way back in 1996, a full 20 years ago when Spice Girls were number 1 in the charts with Wannabe.

<h2>What is World Physical Therapy Day?</h2>
This year's theme focuses on an important subject for all therapists - Movement For Health. The campaign message is 'Add life to Years'. The reasoning behind the theme is due to the recent findings in the [WHOâ€™s World Report on Ageing and Health](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2015/older-persons-day/en/).

<h2>How to take part</h2>
[WCPT](http://www.wcpt.org/) have kindly created an awesome toolkit to help physical therapists convey their campaign's key messages:

Physical therapists help older people be independent, improving their quality of life and reducing health care costs.
Physical therapists address the non-communicable diseases which compromise independence in older age.
Structured and tailored exercise programmes are often essential to promote independence in older people.

The toolkit comprises of leaflets, posters, stickers and can be found [here](http://www.wcpt.org/wptday-toolkit).  The day will be widely publicised on social media, using the #addlifetoyears and #WorldPTDay hashtags.
