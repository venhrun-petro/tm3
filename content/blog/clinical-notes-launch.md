<h2>Runup to the launch</h2>

In the runup to the launch, Blue Zinc decided to give something back to launch signups, and increase the excitement a little by running a small marketing campaign. The campaign ran for 3 days and consisted of a promotion each day.

On day one, signups were informed about a golden ticket promotion. A golden ticket was placed in one of the signups launch packs (we talk about this later). The golden ticket awarded the new occupant with 12 months free clinic notes. A huge surprise and a very generous award.

Day two provided signups with a generous voucher for 50% off group training. Selling TM3 is important, ensuring our clients use and benefit from the software is most important. Pardon the cliche, but practice really does make perfect and at TM3 we ensure our clients have access to [training](https://www.tm3practicemanagement.com/learning/training/) at all times, including webinars, group training, on-site training, and a very comprehensive knowledge base.

On the final day before launch, signups should have received a launch pack to ramp up the excitement*. The pack included lots of goodies from luxury biscuits to popcorn; everything required to make a launch event extra special. 


<h2>The Launch</h2>

TM3 clinical notes was launched on 1st and 2nd February. The launch took the format of a digital launch, broadcasted via YouTube to hundreds of practitioners. Viewers were treated to glimpses of TM3 clinical notes and the new features it boasts.
