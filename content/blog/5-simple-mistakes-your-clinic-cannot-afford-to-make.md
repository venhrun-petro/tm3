I’m often asked what the best way to improve a clinic and believe me there are different answers! So I thought I’d put together a simple list from my travels around the country, here are my top five mistakes clinics cannot afford to make:

<h2>1.Not answering the phone</h2>

Patients usually call when they are in need of help. Put yourself in their shoes ... in their hour of need are you there to help them? It’s easy to make a very good impression or on the other hand it can look as though you are not interested in their problem. You can’t work all the time so how about a reception service that never sleeps? ... 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year ... a service which is tailored to your needs and can book appointments in your diary for you. TM3 24/7 can do this for you to find out more go to:

<h2>2.Unprofessional notes / illegible notes</h2>

Whether you are squinting your eyes to read your colleagues notes or rifling through a filing cabinet to find the correct folder these days the excuses are over. Clear, legible clinical notes make life easier. They are easy on the eye, template led and can be found and printed at a click of a button. They may also help with defence at a hearing as incomplete and illegible notes is one of the major factors contributing to a negative outcomes for practitioners.

<h2>3.Not having Letter templates</h2>

Admission, interim and discharge ..... sending letters use to take ages. Finding the GP’s address, typing it out, setting the margins etc.... Well that should be a thing of the past. If you use letter templates in TM3 the main body of the document including the addresses will automatically be created, we can even add your logo so all you have to do is type your relevant clinical findings and you’re done.   It’s even saved to the patient’s record so it’s easy to find another time. This will definitely help you claw back precious hours from your working week.

<h2>4.Not Emailing letters and invoices</h2>

Still posting letters and invoices? Apart from the time it takes, the printer ink, envelopes and stamps soon add up to around £1 a letter. How many letters do you send a week, a month ...a year? For me it’s the easiest time and money saving improvement a clinic can make .... you can’t afford not to!

<h2>5.Not using Reports to run your business</h2>

There are over 50 standard reports in TM3 and one of the most popular webinars recently was my top 10 reports. The business bit of clinics is not always taught at college so it’s little surprise that some practitioners can find this area challenging. Do not fear, you can access webinars, articles and much much more using TM3 2gether. Login to access this fantastic resource....
