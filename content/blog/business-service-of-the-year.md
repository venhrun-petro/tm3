It’s great to see all our hard work come to light. TM3 private practice software has been shortlisted for the [Business Services Of The Year Award](http://www.copashow.co.uk/awards/) at the COPA Exhibition which takes place on 15-16th June.

<h2>Business Service Of The Year Award</h2>
COPA have described the award as, ‘The only award unique to COPA, this accolade recognises the most innovative service which has assisted business owners in growing their business.’ We think this desciption fits TM3 perfectly considering TM3 is helping clinics around the world reach their true potential. 

<h2>Innovation Of The Year Award</h2>
If truth be told, TM3 could have been placed in another award category, the Innovation Of The Year Award, but sadly one product was only allowed to enter one award. We think TM3 could have performed pretty well in this category.

<h2>Visitors Choice Award</h2>
The third award up for grabs at COPA is the Visitors Choice Award. This is where you become the judge. Attendees can use the power of Twitter to cast their vote for who they believe is the inspiration of the show - we hope it’s TM3! Simply tweet TM3 using the hashtag: #innovateREHAB

<h2>Thank You!</h2>
We would like to take this moment to thank all our amazing clients who have supported us throughout the years. It’s you guys who keep us motivated to change the industry through clinic software development and innovation.
