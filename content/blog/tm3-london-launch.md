<h2>Thank you!</h2>

What a success! Blue Zinc IT would first like to thank everyone for turning up on a cold, rainy night in London to experience the highly anticipated launch of TM3. It's safe to say the rain did not dampen the spirits. 
 
<h2>History was made</h2>

At a packed out 01zeroOne (yes, the name proved to be confusing) history was made. After many hours of development, and over 500,000 lines of code, the highly anticipated TM3 private practice software was ready to be released to the world.
 
<h2>The calm before the storm</h2>

With over 60 attendees, and over 200 watching online, all eyes were on TM3. The {{ i18n "msk" }} industry's newest private practice software did not disappoint! The crowd was drawn in by the uniqueness of the product. Which is understandable considering TM3 is the first private practice software to combine the power and security of desktop software with the flexibility of a cloud solution.
 
<h2>TM3's big moment</h2>

After food, drinks and a lot of anticipation, TM3 was ready to be presented by Blue Zinc IT director Kyle Lunn. The presentation began with the history of Blue Zinc IT, followed by a few minutes focusing on the potential of the Pronto Network, and finally ending with the star of the show, TM3. During the presentation, the crowd was teased with snippets of the software, and premiered the new [TM3 video](www.tm3practicemanagement.com). The new video provided a fun insight into how the private practice software plays an important role in each department within a clinic. 
 
<h2>Finally, TM3 was ready to shine!</h2>

After the presentation, guests were treated to product demonstrations and were encouraged to play around with the private practice software. TM3 exceed expectations with attendees singing the software's praises and complimenting its beauty,simplicity and most of all, it's functionality.
 
<h2>What the guests had to say about the new Private Practice Software</h2>

"Physio in the city is very excited about the launch of new TM3 . Thank-you for a fantastic launch night in London great to see you all!" , said Jill Dean, Physio In The City. After the event, Kyle Lunn, Director, Blue Zinc IT added, "TM3 is now available and will help bring better flexibility, security and success to clinics worldwide."
